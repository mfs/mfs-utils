## A bunch of simple utilities.

- ap A simple ansible wrapper that uses a default playbook name and hosts inventory.
- find-images Search for images greater than a certain dimension.
- check-repo Check a git repo's remote for new tags.
- media A simple mplayer launcher.
- mkzone Generate BIND zone files from yaml files. Haven't actually tried using
one of the generated files in BIND yet so caveat emptor.
